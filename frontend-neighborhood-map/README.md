# Frontend-neighborhood-map-project

This project shows the major attracrions of San Francisco city on google map. To get the details of each pin-pointed location on the map, click on the marker and the data will be fetched from Foursquare API JSON response and displayed inside the info Window of that marker.
This project was built using the Knockout JS framework. It's an MVVM (model view viewmodel) that helps separate the view from the viewmodel. The MVVM framework allows exponential scaleability. jQuery is also used to help with JSON and infowindow population.
